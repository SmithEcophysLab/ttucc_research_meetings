# TTU Climate Center research meeting notes
## March 21, 2024

- climate center research symposium
	- folks are generally supportive
	- may need a lot of time to get this put together
		- spring next year?
	- could tie into fundraising (e.g., donors for event)

- natasja van gestel research presentation
	- modulation of environment-carbon cycle impacts by biology in ecosystems
	- land sink strength (aim 1)
		- determine whether impacted by warming
		- antarctica + other places
		- warming impacts carbon in and out of ecosystems
		- not clear how warming will impact ecosystem C
		- antarctica work
			- one of most rapidly warming regions in the world
			- glaciers receding with warming
				- receded 600 m at the study site (palmer station)
			- gradient of glacier recession at site
			- open top chambers to warm the ecosystem
			- results: warming is reducing the carbon sink
			- also doing more detailed physiology on mosses
			- linking gene expression to moss physiology
			- also looking at microbes in the ecosystem
				- stable isotope method for microbial growth
	- carbon sequestration in agricultural soils (aim 2)
		- putting carbon in the soils make the soils better and mitigate climate change
		- done in lubbock
			- cotton
		- using on-farm fields to look at the practices that might help with soil C sequestration
			- no till
			- residue retention
			- cover crops
			- rotating crops
		- heat and drought effects on cotton physiology and carbon balance of ecosystems
		- impact of biochar on soil carbon and cotton yield
		- soil water dynamics in agro-ecosystems
	- questions
		- isotope labeling can be used for fungi as well as bacteria
		- there are macrofungi growing in antarctica
		- microbial diversity and activity are linked
			- team is working on making this linkage
		- microbes also influences the environment
		- nee also related to atmospheric mixing
		- anaerobic decomposition?
			- not measuring

- future research meetings
	- sandip is up for it!
		- soil-atmosphere feedbacks
