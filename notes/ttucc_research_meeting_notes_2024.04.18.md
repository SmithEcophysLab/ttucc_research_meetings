# ttu CC research meetings
## april 18, 2024

- announcements
	- SC-CASC FY25 funding announcement
		- https://app.smartsheetgov.com/b/publish?EQBCT=2448d46632884098a03610f707e5d1fc
	- creating generic climate center brochure for arbor day, etc.
	- climate center research day
		- still enthusiasm for that
	- nick working on getting funding for a CC coordinator position
		- would like to hear support for this from other CC affiliates (nick will send message out)
	- Checking with Joe Heppert to fund a Research Coordinator position (through TUF funding) 
	for at least a year. Position for Research Coordinator will be part of the next SC CASC 
	rebid. Coordinator could potentially help with research day.

	- plant invasion mechanisms
		- specifically: allelopathy (chemical weapon against native plants)
	- garlic mustard is invasive species that exudes allelochemicals
		- widespread negative effects on native species
	- negative effects are through the breakdown between plant-fungal symbioses
	- currently working to understand underlying mechanisms
		- manipulation experiments
		- photosynthesis measurements
		- showed some field results
	- connection to climate change
		- interactions with elevated co2 (more allelochemicals?)
		- interactions with warming (changes in phenology)
	- current work
		- seasonal carbon budgets for native plants under invasion
		- scaling to population demography
	- other research interests
		- plant carbon-nitrogen interactions
		- plant responses to elevated CO2 and N relations
	- **open to collaborations**
